## Neural Network Representation
NN with a **single** hidden layer.

This is called a 2 layer NN - we don't count the input layer (called layer 0).

The hidden layer has associated with parameters w<sup>[1]</sup> and b<sup>[1]</sup>.

The output layer has associated with parameters w<sup>[2]</sup> and b<sup>[2]</sup>.

a<sup>[1]</sup> = [a<sup>[1]</sup><sub>1</sub>; a<sup>[1]</sup><sub>2</sub>; a<sup>[1]</sup><sub>3</sub>] &rarr; 3 dimensional because the NN's hidden layer has 3 hidden units.
